# MP3-Player
Overlay based Android 4.4 themed(?) song player for Android 6+

- How to set up
1. Install the app. Once installed, open it
2. You may see the UI.....i am lazy to complete it
3. Tap the button, which should take you to a special settings menu
4. It will ask you to enable permission for overlay, you are required to grant it (only then it will appear)
5. Next, allow permissions for files and audio (files are for indexing songs, audio is for the small visualizer)
6. Once all permissions are granted, tap the button and voila! The overlay should appear!

#### If overlay does not appear, this may be an issue on my side or on your device.
